# ASSIGNMENT 
#### Course: Computer Network, Semester 1, 2022-2023
## Objectives
- Build a chat application according to the communication protocols defined by each group, using the TCP / IP protocols.
## Application Description
- a)	The application allows two or more users on different machines to chat with each other
- b)	The chat client is built on the hybrid model between the Client-Server and P2P models. The system has a central server for user registration and online user management, but clients chat directly with each other. (Students can refer to Napster for an illustration).
- c)	One person has a list of friends retrieved from the central server. He/she can start some chats with different people at the same time. Each conversation is a P2P connection.
- d)	Application allows file transfer during chats between clients through P2P connection. 
- e)	The application must use communication protocols already pre-defined by each group.
## Working plan
Work in a team.
-	Each group has up to 4 members.
-	Phase 1 (First 2 weeks):
    -	Define specific functions of the chat application
    -	Define the communication protocols used for each function
-	Phase 2 (Next 2 weeks)
    -	Implement and refine the application according to the functions and protocols defined in Phase 1
## Results
###### a.	Phase 1 (softcopy):
-	Submit the report file of the first phase to BKeL in the predefined section as announced on BKeL.
-	File format (pdf): `ASS1_P1_<<Group_Name>>.pdf`
-	This report includes:
    -	Define and describe the functions of the application
    - Define the protocols used for each function

###### b.	Phase 2 (hard and softcopy): 
###### c.	Submit the report file of the assignment to BKeL
###### d.	File format (`.rar`): `ASS1_<<Group_name>>.rar`
###### e.	This report includes:
-	Phase 1 content
-	Describe each specific function of the application
-	Detailed application design (architecture, class diagrams, main classes ...)
-	Validation (sanity test) and evaluation of actual result (performance)
-	Extension functions of the system in addition to the requirements specified in section 2
-	Participantsâ€™ roles and responsibilities
-	Manual document
-	Source code (softcopy) 
-	Application file (softcopy) compiled from source code 
## Evaluation
Assignment 1 is worth 15% of the course grade.
